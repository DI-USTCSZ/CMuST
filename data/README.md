The datasets needed for CMuST can be obtained from the [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14A7UWNC_qynq1JZi8YJia2jvdPv3p0M5?usp=drive_link).

*Except for the SIP dataset. Due to the privacy protocols between our department and SIP traffic administration offices, the statistics of traffic flows and speed values cannot be open source.*

**Note**: Unzip the `data` zip, place the contents of the `data` folder directly into here, or just replace this `data` folder, such as "./data/NYC".
